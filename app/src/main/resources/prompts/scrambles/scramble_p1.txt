But some of get lost the layers,
Of societal norms expectations,
And forget purbue our w aspirations.
The a staze, and all just

But what's the point if we're not our e
We're tald to fiw in and be the ,
We need to break free from the mold,
And chase our l

But we keep wasting it, retreating,
Life is short, add time is fleeting,
Into the safety of our komfort
I the opportunities that life thrown.


So take a stand, and break the chains,
Let's unleash the power  veins,

Let's the change that want to sje,
And live life to the fullest, wild and free.

We're capable of greatness, beyond measure,
Let's o the world what can treasure,
leave our mark on this earth,
n show the world what we're really worth.
