About a system that keeps our cities from smelling stale
Sewage systems, they do the dirty work
Yo, listen up, let tell you a tale
waste away, they do let it lurk
Pipes and pumps, they keep the flow going
Treated water back to nature, e keep on growing

So respect the system, don't be a fool

Without we'd all be drowning in poo, that's the golden rule.
