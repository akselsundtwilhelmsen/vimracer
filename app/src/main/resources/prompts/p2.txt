Yo, listen up, let me tell you a tale
About a system that keeps our cities from smelling stale
Sewage systems, they do the dirty work
Carrying waste away, they don't let it lurk
Pipes and pumps, they keep the flow going
Treated water back to nature, we keep on growing
So respect the system, don't be a fool
Without it, we'd all be drowning in poo, that's the golden rule.
