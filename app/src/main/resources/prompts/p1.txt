The world's a stage, and we're all just players,
But some of us get lost in the layers,
Of societal norms and expectations,
And forget to pursue our own aspirations.

We're told to fit in and be like the rest,
But what's the point if we're not our best?
We need to break free from the mold,
And chase our dreams, uncontrolled.

Life is short, and time is fleeting,
But we keep wasting it, retreating,
Into the safety of our comfort zones,
Ignoring the opportunities that life has thrown.

So let's take a stand, and break the chains,
Let's unleash the power in our veins,
Let's be the change that we want to see,
And live life to the fullest, wild and free.

We're capable of greatness, beyond measure,
Let's show the world what we can treasure,
Let's leave our mark on this earth,
And show the world what we're really worth.
